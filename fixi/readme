OS: Linux

Run 'make' to compile server.cc and client.cc into two separate binaries namely 'tsamP3_GROUP_2' and 'client'.

Run 'tsamP3_GROUP_2' to start the server, providing the listening port number on command line. It will listen for clients on port 9001.

Use 'client' to communicate with the server, providing the server address and port number on command line. The client will prompt for a password to authenticate with the server. Use 'ilovecats' to authenticate.

Sent and received messages will be logged into a file 'message-logs.txt' along with the timestamps.
